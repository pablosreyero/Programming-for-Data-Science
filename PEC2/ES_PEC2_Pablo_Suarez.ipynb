        "* **Es necesario incluir comentarios** de vuestro código, que expliquen cómo ha implementado la solución del problema planteado.  \n",
        "* **Es imprescindible** citar las referencias consultadas para realizar la actividad. Se valorará que el código proporcionado solucione el problema propuesto y también la calidad del código (comentarios, legibilidad, claridad, uso de las estructuras de datos adecuadas, buena nomenclatura de las variables y funciones, seguimiento del PEP8, etc. ).\n",
        "\n",
        "Vereis que cada una de las actividades tiene asociada una puntuación, que indica el peso que tiene la actividad sobre la nota de la PEC.

Será necesario que el estudiante busque esta información utilizando los recursos que se han explicado en la asignatura.\n",
        "\n",
        "Es importante notar que estas etiquetas no indican el nivel de dificultad del ejercicio, sino únicamente la necesidad de consulta de documentación externa para su resolución. Además, recuerde que las **etiquetas son informativas**, pero puede consultar referencias externas siempre que lo desee (aunque no se indique explícitamente) o puede que pueda realizar una actividad sin consultar ningún tipo de documentación. Por ejemplo, para resolver una actividad que sólo requiera los materiales de la asignatura, puede consultar referencias externas si se desea, ya sea tanto para ayudar en la resolución como para ampliar conocimientos!\n",

        "1. Comprobad que el notebook se ejecuta correctamente en google colab. Es importante que antes de entregar la PEC comprobéis que la versión final del código que se entrega se ejecuta correctamente en su totalidad. Para ello, recomendamos realizar una ejecución completa desde cero del notebook: haga click en *Runtime > Disconnect and Delete Runtime & Run All* y comprobeis que el notebook se ejecuta correctamente.\n",
        "2. Activad las alertas de estilo y comprobad que el código sigue las convenciones de estilo de Python. Si es necesario, modificad el código para adecuarlo.\n",
        "3. Confirma que eres el autor único de la PEC y que ésta incluye todas las citas a recursos externos que se hayan utilizado para elaborarla. Añade tu nombre completo al párrafo de la celda siguiente.\n",
        "4. Para esta PEC sólo será necesario entregar el archivo con el notebook (con extensión .ipynb). Nosotros añadiremos la carpeta \"data\".\n",
        "5. Entregad la PEC a través del aula: \"Actividades, Entrega de la actividad PEC1\".\n",

        "**Respuesta:** Verdadero, pero habiendo estudiado la teoría, considero que esta pregunta tiene tres respuestas. La primera, es que si lo que se quiere hacer, es solo leer la variable, no hace falta poner ese término. Ahora bien, si lo que se quiere es; escribir/modificar la variable global, con el fin de que el resto de funciones que prosigan lean el nuevo valor, entonces es imprescindible poner ese término. Por último, si se quiere usar una variable local con el mismo nombre que la variable global dentro de una función, entonces no hace falta poner el término, ya que aunque tenga el mismo nombre que la variable global, esta no va a escirbir en la variable global porque no son el mismo tipo de variables.\n",

My wife who was also in the car, witness the sighting.  I jumped out of the car, and I observed a large craft that resembled a building that appeared to be on its side.  It had what appeared to me to be windows, like an office building and they were all dimly lithe up with yellow lights.  There were many windows throughout the craft, and not all of the windows were lithe up.  Other than the lights that were in the windows, there were no other visibible lights throughout the craft.  The size of the windows appeared to me to be about 7 foot tall and 4 foot wide, with perfect corners. The craft was about 300 yards long (and not clear on how wide or deep it was).  It was quiet with no sound at all. It was very windy that night. The craft was slow moving and on an even keel.  It was traveling south bound. The first ! pass lasted about 3 minutes, and then disappeared, long enough for me to get back into my car.  Then it came back on a north bound track and again that lasted about 3 minutes.  It appeared to be a dark color and not shinny, like a grey almost black in color. We tried to make a report by calling the airport, but we could never get through because all of the lines were giving us a busy signal.  There were two other men that witness the craft that night. I never got their names, and do not know if they also tried to make a report.  I am an experienced pilot and airplane builder. I have no logical explanation as to why this type craft was flying that night. A craft of that size and shape I find it impossible to have any type of flying capabilities. I can only assume, but if there were occupants on this craft, (in my opinion) there is no way that they could be small individuals and had to have been rather large, judging from the size of the windows.

It had what appeared to me to be windows, like an office building and they were all dimly lithe up with yellow lights.  There were many windows throughout the craft, and not all of the windows were lithe up.  Other than the lights that were in the windows, there were no other visibible lights throughout the craft.  The size of the windows appeared to me to be about 7 foot tall and 4 foot wide, with perfect corners. The craft was about 300 yards long (and not clear on how wide or deep it was).  It was quiet with no sound at all. It was very windy that night. The craft was slow moving and on an even keel.  It was traveling south bound. The first ! pass lasted about 3 minutes, and then disappeared, long enough for me to get back into my car.  Then it came back on a north bound track and again that lasted about 3 minutes.  It appeared to be a dark color and not shinny, like a grey almost black in color. We tried to make a report by calling the airport, but we could never get through because all of the lines were giving us a busy signal.  There were two other men that witness the craft that night. I never got their names, and do not know if they also tried to make a report.  I am an experienced pilot and airplane builder. I have no logical explanation as to why this type craft was flying that night. A craft of that size and shape I find it impossible to have any type of flying capabilities. I can only assume, but if there were occupants on this craft, (in my opinion) there is no way that they could be small individuals and had to have been rather large, judging from the size of the windows.

The flashes were about 1 second or less apart. I went inside to get my binoculars. When I came back outside, I waited for the light to reappear, as it had before. It did reappear, but there was only one light and it was more round (it was still no larger than Mars looked recently, but this was not Mars)and the color was more of a yellow-orangish hue. It had also moved about 10 degrees to the east and only flashed once. I waited for more.

It had what appeared to me to be windows, like an office building and they were all dimly lithe up with yellow lights.  There were many windows throughout the craft, and not all of the windows were lithe up.  Other than the lights that were in the windows, there were no other visibible lights throughout the craft.

The first ! pass lasted about 3 minutes, and then disappeared, long enough for me to get back into my car.  Then it came back on a north bound track and again that lasted about 3 minutes.

The best way to describe it would have to be like a perfect symmetrical pyramid and/or triangle.  Like if you cut off the top of the Great Pyramid of Giza... It was all black.  It made absolutely no noise.  It floated parallel with a major road in my town over the back end of neighborhood.  It was incredible…  There were 4 lights... there were 3 that were you know the normal white light on the 3 corners, 1 in each corner.  And in the center there was a red light..... Now the only difference is the first time I saw this same similar object with my friend the red light wasn't blinking.  On, March, 30th 2011 the RED light was BLINKING...  Not sure if it means anything. (I saw a similar object on a separate occasion with a friend, a few years ago probably 2 but in the same county) I called 911.  I have no idea if they took me serious or actually followed it up.  But, I was in shock just for the fact it was so close to my home. Another example is if you look at the back of a One Dollar bill.

We were parked on a small side road in Sedona, Arizona (with a sign that said “private residences” or something like that that my dad ignored!), just before the main road takes you to a large parking area.  We were standing in a small empty lot between two houses.  This picture was taken in between two other pictures taken at 4:08 pm and 4:16 pm.  The UFO image in this photo is not in the other two photos taken before and after.  Two other people with me were also taking photos at around the same time and the UFO is not in their photos, either.  None of us saw it with our eyes.  I took this picture with a Nikon Coolpix L12V1.0.  The picture has the following properties:  fstop – f/5.7 exposure time – 1/172 sec ISO speed – ISO-50 exposure bias – 0 step focal length – 6mm max aperture – 3.4 metering mode – pattern size – 3072x2304 300 dpi.  Very interesting, to say the least.  I’m very skeptical when it comes to UFO claims.  But this picture really caught my eye when I was scrolling through my photos after downloading them to the computer.  I couldn’t believe it, actually, and we all had a good laugh.  My family has been pressing me to report this for months.  I finally am doing so now.  After attempting to recreate an image with a UFO in it by putting a small fleck of paper on the lens, and also throwing rocks in the air to try to catch a snapshot of one of them to see if a similar image could be created, we couldn’t do it.  It didn’t work.  I don’t know what this UFO in my picture is, but I’m becoming more and more convinced it’s not a fleck of dust or a rock being thrown.  Maybe it’s a skeet?  I have no idea.  I don’t know if there are any skeet shooting ranges in that area.  Or maybe it’s an alien vessel?  Maybe we’ll never know.

Truly appreciated.

And here I thought I had some incredible phenonomen...*grin*  Darn!!!!  :-)  Thank you again for your time and just hope I did not take too much of it up, knowing now what it is....God bless....and keep up the great work on your wonderful site.

I had a cut-out cardboard box around my head to block out the street & residential security lights in the neighborhood, making my view of the clear but hazey sky quite clear.  I had laid there admiring shooting stars when at about 12:25 AM a small airplane flew North over me in Oak Cliff, a suburb of Dallas, Texas.  Its North-South trajectory was about a few blocks to the West of my position.  I imagine it to have been following the path of Westmoreland Boulevard.  Before I could see it, I remembered the noisey little airplane by its distinctive sound, since it flies North and/or South over our house frequently at night, always disturbing my sleep.  It triggered the usual question: why aren't such airplanes required to muffle their noise, especially at night?  As it passed over my line of sight, I noticed something following it.  I first thought the plane was towing something behind it, because the object behind the airplane was traveling the same speed and at approximately the same altitude.  It was so dimly illuminated it was hard to see.  It's image area was about six to eight times larger than the small airplane's image area.  All I could see of it was three elongated octagons (rectangles with the corners cut off).  Their lengths ran the direction the craft traveled.  The octagons were in a common plane, two in the back and one in center front, evenly spaced apart in a triangular formation.  It was about one to two hundred yards behind the small airplane and slightly to the West of the airplane's trajectory.  It flew in a straight, level line without deviations.  Either the small airplane was making so much noise that I couldn't discerne the object's sound.  Or, the object was making no noise at all.  The object's three elongated octagonal panels were either very dimly: but evenly illuminated, or they were finished with a non-reflective or ultra-flat coating that evenly diffused their reflection of the city's ground lights over their surfaces.  No sharp ground lights were reflected off of them as it passed over.  And, I don't know if it was a single craft or three individual aircrafts flying in continuous and perfect formation.  I stood and turned around to continue watching it and the airplane as they flew away from me, to the North toward Love Field.  As they dissappeared in the misty distance I couldn't descerne anything about the object's shape.  As the three panels became flat in the distance, the whole thing seemed to dissappear.  But, I could still see the airplane's blinking lights and barely still hear the airplane's noisey exhaust.  I immediately went downstairs to write down and sketch what I'd seen.  Just after one o'clock I called Love Field Tower.  A recording gave me a night phone number.  I called that number at 1:10 AM.  Someone named Gary answered the phone.  I briefly described what I'd seen.  He said he was on the field and to call him back in twenty minutes when he'd be back in his office.  I called him again at 1:30 AM and again told him what I'd seen.  He said he'd talked to the tower and they'd heard nothing from anyone else about it.  I reminded him that the tower's nightn phone number isn't even listed, so the public couldn't have called the tower unless it was a relative or other airport official who already knew the tower's night number, deducing that HE would be the only one to have recieved any calls about it.  He completely ignored that.  It seemed as though he was partonizing or attempting to placate me.  He didn't seem genuinely interested, failing to ask for my name, phone number or any information about the sighting that I hadn't volunteered.  I asked him if there is an official phone number where such sightings are supposed to be reported.  He said, No, that I'd called the right number.  So, I appologized for bothering him with such ridiculous nonsense and hung up.  I was left feeling disgruntled, unsatisfied and embarrassed.  Now, that I know the National UFO Reporting Center is listed in the FAA Manual as the correct place to report unusual sky sightings, I'll call ole doubting Gary back tonight to provide him with the NUFOREC's phone number, remind him to read his manual and give him a free piece of my mind.  I saw a similarly unusual flying object many years ago (I'm bad with past chronology) several miles East of Tyler, Texas.  It was deep in the dark piney East Texas forrest.  The night was clear and the stars were amazingly bright.  The thing appeared to be a sharp triangle, only distinguished by it's blocking out the star's light behind it as it passed over me heading East.  It was moving too slowly, in my opinion, to be an airplane.  It didn't exhibit the three elongated octagonal shapes on the bottom.  If it was the same type craft, I suppose this was because there was no ground light to illuminate them.  It was exactly the same color and intensity of the background night sky.  It, too, made absolutely no sound.  And, I was alone then, too.   I seriously doubt these craft were man-made.  And, I no longer have any doubts that we are NOT alone on our God-forsaken, bloodthursty, demockery-cursed, predatory little planet.
